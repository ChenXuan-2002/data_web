    "methods_html": "<h2>Study Introduction (English)</h2><p>The primary objective of this database is to explore the factors influencing HIV self-testing (HIVST) behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM), based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Chengdu, China, from March to May 2022, employing a non-random sampling method. Participants were recruited in collaboration with a local MSM-friendly organization, the Chengdu Tongle Health Consultation Service Center, through three primary channels: (1) MSM receiving HIV testing and counseling services at Tongle, (2) outreach surveys conducted at MSM gathering venues (e.g., bars, bathhouses), and (3) online invitations sent via Tongle’s volunteer peer network. A total of 610 MSM were approached, with 499 valid participants, yielding an 82% response rate.</p><h2>Questionnaire & Coding (English)</h2><p>(1) General Demographic Information: Age, ethnicity, place of residence, education level, marital status, employment status, average monthly income, and sexual orientation.</p><p>(2) Sexual Behavior: Sexual activity over the past 6 months, number of regular and casual sexual partners, condom use, drug use, history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and occurrences of group sex.</p><p>(3) HIV Testing Behavior: HIV testing history (past 6 months/lifetime), number of tests, types of testing, and satisfaction with testing.</p><p>(4) Information: Knowledge of HIV prevention, recognition, treatment, and self-testing.</p><p>(5) Motivation: Perceived HIV risk, intention to test, social norms, and attitudes toward HIV testing.</p><p>(6) Testing Skills: Self-efficacy related to HIV testing and perceived difficulty in undergoing testing.</p><p>(7) Additional Variables: Social support (emotional, material, informational, accompaniment), anticipated stigma related to HIV infection, internalized stigma among MSM, and reactions to negative HIV test results.</p><p>(8) Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Voluntary participation, age (18+), sex assigned at birth (male), male-male sexual behavior within the last 6 months, minimum questionnaire completion time (≥6 minutes), and absence of substantial duplication or obvious logical errors.</p>",

        "abstract": "HIV self-testing (HIVST) has been shown to complement existing facility-based testing services and promote regular HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM). However, HIVST uptake among Chinese MSM remains suboptimal, with existing studies reporting a testing rate below 50%. While the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model has often been employed to understand health behaviors, its application to quantitatively investigate HIVST remains limited. An anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted among 499 eligible MSM in Chengdu, China, from March to May 2022. The psychometric properties of the IMB components were validated using confirmatory factor analysis and Analysis of Moment Structures. The associations between IMB factors and HIVST were explored through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Factors identified in the regression analyses were subsequently included in a structural equation modeling framework. A total of 178 individuals (35.7%) reported HIVST in the last 6 months. Higher self-testing knowledge (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.07-2.23), positive attitudes toward self-testing—specifically regarding test accuracy (aOR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.02-1.63) and confidentiality (aOR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.10-1.62)—and greater behavioral skills related to self-testing (aOR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04-1.20) were independently associated with higher HIVST uptake. In the IMB model, information (β = 0.118, p = 0.027), motivation (β = 0.263, p < 0.001), and behavioral skills (β = 0.149, p = 0.002) each demonstrated a direct positive effect on HIVST. Additionally, behavioral skills partially mediated the effects between information (β = 0.235, p < 0.001) and motivation (β = 0.131, p = 0.010) on HIVST. These findings indicate that interventions targeting IMB components are essential for improving HIVST uptake among Chinese MSM. In particular, health education focusing on self-testing knowledge, assurance of test kit validity, and empowerment through skill-building interventions may facilitate greater adoption of HIVST in this population."

        "abstract": "The introduction of the undetectable equals untransmittable (U = U) statement significantly reduces HIV stigma and provides an empirical basis for achieving 'zero transmission.' U = U messaging has gained increasing support and is well-developed in several countries. However, the current status of accurate knowledge of U = U and its associated factors among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China remains unclear. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among MSM recruited in Chengdu, China, from March to May 2022 to investigate the percentage of those who knew U = U accurately and to explore associations between sexual risk behaviors, HIV testing, socio-behavioral measures, and accurate knowledge of U = U. Of 497 MSM included in our study, 23.4% (116/497) had accurate knowledge of U = U. More than half of the participants (63.2%, 314/497) reported multiple sexual partnerships, 15.7% (78/497) used substance during sex, 37.4% (186/497) reported inconsistent condom use, and 76.1% (378/497) took HIV testing in the past six months. Factors associated with accurate knowledge of U = U among MSM included substance use during sex (multivariate odds ratios ORm = 1.96; 95%CI: 1.13–3.41), HIV status tested in the last six months (ORm = 2.07; 95%CI: 1.14–3.77), HIV-related literacy (ORm = 1.41; 95%CI: 1.14–1.74) and perceived higher risk of HIV infection (ORm = 1.11; 95%CI: 1.02–1.21). The findings indicate that great challenges need to be conquered for U = U achievement among the MSM population in Chengdu, China. Intervention strategies should be prioritized in health education on high-risk behaviors such as group sex and substance use, information provision and counseling of U = U in HIV testing services, and encouraging U = U knowledge sharing among MSM with their partners in China."
